# Open-TV

Simple & fast IPTV app made with Electron and Angular

![alt text](https://github.com/Fredolx/open-tv/blob/main/demo.png)

## Why

- Hypnotix was god awful slow and I needed something better for my relatives
- Lack of good open source IPTV apps
- Faster and much more stable than the alternatives

## Planned features

- ~~Recording channels~~
- ~~Clearing cache via GUI and/or multiple sources support~~
- Xtream support
- Providing better support for bad streams (proxying the source and relaying to mpv)
- Publishing on Flathub

## Prerequisites
```
sudo dnf install mpv #Fedora
sudo pacman -Syu mpv #Arch
sudo apt install mpv #Debian/Ubuntu
scoop install mpv # Windows
choco install mpv # Windows alternative
```

## Contribute
Just submit a PR anytime if you find something you want to improve. Otherwise check
the bugs category and pick something. It's really a hobby project after all so don't
stress it. I'm not a big javascript/nodejs guy so you will certainly find things to
improve just by looking at the code.

## Install
You can install the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/Fredolx/open-tv/releases/)
