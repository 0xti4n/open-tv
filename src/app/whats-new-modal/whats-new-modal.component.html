    Open TV is in crucial need of your help. Consider donating any amount (even 1$, it makes a big
    difference!) to support future development.

    1.8.0 is the Fan Edition! It combines all the most hotly requested features from all of you and
    bunch of crucial bugfixes. I always made Open TV mostly to my own taste, but this changes today
    as this update celebrates your support by implementing every single popular feature request. I
    hope you'll enjoy it.

    On a seperate note, Open TV Mobile has finally launched! It's a bit of an early release so
    expect a few bugs. Every purchase directly contributes to the development.

    I am currently looking for a job in Canada. I haven't had a permanent position for the last 3
    years and would really appreciate any decent opportunity.

    Stalker (mac address login) users! I haven't forgotten about you and an upcoming app is in the
    works. It's mostly done and you can get updates about it on my BlueSky.

  <h3>Changes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Vastly improved navigation. Keyboard navigation should be a lot smoother. Use Escape or
      Backspace to go back in any view. Press F1 for more details. Please send feedback if you like
      keyboard-centric apps.
    </li>
    <li>
      Categories view now follows your media type filters. Only want to see categories of vods? It's
      here.
    </li>
    <li>Series are now organized in seasons. This was probably the most requested feature.</li>
    <li>Playback of channels can be cancelled by just clicking on them again. No more zombies.</li>
    <li>Squashed a ton of xtream bugs</li>
    <li>Open TV now remembers your last search before entering a category, series or season</li>
    <li>
      Re-added the scrollbar. I personally don't like it, but you guys do, so it's back. I will
      consider making it an option if I get feedback that I'm not the only scrollbar hater.
    </li>
    <li>All episodes are added to the queue when playing an episode</li>
    <li>
      The linux flatpak package now uses mpv as base, which means it should be kept up-to-date with
      the latest dependencies in a more consistent fashion.
    </li>
    <li>Updated all dependencies</li>
  </ul>
