    Open TV is in crucial need of your help. Consider donating any amount (even 1$, it makes a big
    difference!) to support future development.

  <h3>Changes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Added an option in settings to conveniently enable hardware decoding (HWDEC=auto), enabled by
      default.
    </li>
    <li>
      Added an option in settings to enable modern hardware features for the player (HDR, gpu UI,
      etc). Not enabled by default, please try to enable it if you have a recent GPU.
    </li>
    <li>
      Added an option in settings to always ask where to save files (VOD/Catchback downloads,
      recording).
    </li>
    <li>Added an option in settings to clear history</li>
    <li>
      Reduced permissions of flatpak package to the bare minimum. Using Open TV in a containerized
      environment like flatpak/distrobox/podman/appImage will act as if "Always ask where to save
      file" is on.
    </li>
    <li>Fixed a bug with EPG not working on some Xtream subscriptions</li>
    <li>Added a .rpm to the releases for Fedora/RHEL</li>
  </ul>
